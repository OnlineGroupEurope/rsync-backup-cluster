rsync-backup-cluster
====================

rsync-backup-cluster consists of a scheduler application that provides
a API and manages all your jobs and a worker daemon that can be scaled
horizontally to handle your rsync jobs.

rsync-backup-cluster supports stepping into the source directory and
creating separate jobs for subdirectories while still keeping the
directory structure on the target.
